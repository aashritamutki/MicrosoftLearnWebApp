    NKOCET has been at the vanguard of academics since 2008. Our vision is to provide ‘Locally Rooted, Globally Competent Education.’ With this vision in our mind we all work in harmony to take the college to zenith of its glory. So far our college has not only excelled in academics but has also proved its mettle in developing and shaping the overall personality of our students through varied activities. Our students have far outdone in academic results by bagging university merit positions in different subjects. We have turned out to be a model constituent college in the academic sphere of Western Maharashtra. We are committed to focus on the needs of each individual student and aim to nurture each student and ensure their journey at NKOCET is a successful and life-enhancing experience.
    <br><br>
    We believe in student centric Teaching-Learning Pedagogy for imbibing excellence in the domains of engineering. A uniquely designed academic system works in harmony in order to meet the challenges of maintaining strong base in scholastics.
    <br><br>
    To corroborate the learnings at the college our Faculty members undertake industrial training during vacations and constantly upgrade their qualifications through research work. Simultaneously, students take up a well planned industrial training as a part of the curriculum.
    <br><br>
    A great substance is added to the student’s profile through their Project work. At NKOCET, we encourage them to take projects that give experiential learning with lots of creativity and innovation to make them true engineers and not merely engineering graduates.
    <br><br>
    We provide our students with opportunities for a well-rounded educational experience by training them in different industry oriented courses. The Cocurricular courses at NKOCET focus on allowing students to develop a range of important technical skills to excel in their future career and make them Industry Ready Engineer.
    <br><br>
    Additionally, the Soft Skills Training develops in them the ability to adapt to changing circumstances and the willingness to learn. The transition from student life to being a Professional is eased by preparing them to enter the industry with Confidence and Passion.
    <br><br>
    NKOCET addresses industry-institute interaction through regular associations, symposiums, guest lectures, visits, workshops etc. This enables our students to pick up skills besides what is imparted in the classrooms.
    <br><br>
    To sum up, we aim at making our students first day productive engineer for the industry by incorporating and inculcating the essence of employable skills in them. Hence, I urge and welcome the Industry to Orchid Campus and undertake Placements with us for youthful workforce that is full of zeal and talent.
