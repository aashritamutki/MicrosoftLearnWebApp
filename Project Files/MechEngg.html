<h3>
    Mechanical Engineering Department at N.K. Orchid College of Engineering & Technology, Solapur is one of the oldest department in the institute and in this region. The Mechanical Engineering Department is continuously striving to achieve excellence in Academics &Technical Education as well as in Projects in service to the society.Our Department has got the perfect blend of intellectual as well as practical experience faculty members that helps our students to work as an Engineer in society to fulfill the societal needs and become industry ready before leaving the campus.
    <br><br>
    Mechanical Department is well equipped with professional laboratories in specialized domains such as Thermal engineering, Design Engineering, Production Engineering, CAD/CAM and with Interdisciplinary subjects also. In addition to that we have innovation centers such as Thermal, Automobile & Solar Innovation center developed in association with Industry.More than a decade the Mechanical Engineering Department’s connect with the industry is getting stronger year by year through various activities such as Industry Expert Session, Industrial visits, vocational in-plant tracings, Sponsored Projects also having Department Advisory Boardconsisting of Industry Experts etc. Mechanical Engineering Department is amongst the top 7 Engineering Colleges in India for AICTE- CII Best Industry Institute Survey.More focus is given on the enhancement of the placement aspects of the students in the Department, which paid off from last four years. Our Department is focusing on the Research and Development aspects as well as Funding.
    <br><br>
    Faculty Members and Students are continuously exposed to different National-International Competitions, Conferences, Seminars &Training programs to update their knowledge about recent industrial and technological advancements.With academic growth, students can achieve overall development through activities such as Cultural, Debates, Extempore Speeches, Quizzes etc. which are regularly conducted by Mechanical Engineering Student Association (MESA).
