<h2><u><i><strong>About Department</strong></i></u></h2>
<br>
<br>
<h3>
    Department of Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering at NKOCET has taken development as a continuous process and has assured this through upgrading the academic programs, research infrastructure and laboratories. In order to ensure high standards of education, the department is constantly upgrading itself by adding well equipped laboratories to supplement the theory courses. We have a team of highly qualified, experienced, dedicated and self-motivated faculty members. Students are provided with a solid foundation to formulate, solve and analyse engineering problems.
    <br><br>
    The department has strong industry-institute interface, which helps in bridging the gap between college education and industry needs. Various initiatives are regularly taken to give the students a clear and decisive edge in employability through modular and supplementary courses based on industry needs. These include soft skill training and employment oriented co-curricular and extracurricular courses. The Department trains students to be team players to work on multi-disciplinary projects and extend their abilities to co-relate engineering issues to the broader social context.
