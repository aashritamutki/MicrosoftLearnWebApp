<h2><u><i><strong>About Department</strong></i></u></h2>
<br>
<br>
<h3>
Profession of civil engineering retains it ancient era even in the current era of electronics and computer revolution. This branch of engineering touches to entire need of society, civilians that includes shelter and water, roads and bridges, dam and tunnels, environmental pollution and similar construction activities directly related to welfare and human beings. As long as civilization extracts and grows civil engineering profession will persist.
<br>
The department of civil Engineering is established form the inception of college with the intake of 120. The department is having highly qualified faculties with average experience of 12 years. The department is well-established laboratories of modern equipment in the surveying, strength of material, concrete technology, fluid mechanics, geology, applied mechanics etc.
